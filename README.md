# Music-Oriented Synapses 6502
MOS 6502 is a project created as assingment for our Python Programming Course. It lets you generate music using neural network - all it needs is a start sequence. This project consists of three main parts:

* training the neural network,
* generating MIDI files using trained model,
* wrapping everything in GUI.

In order to run it you'll need to have the following python modules installed:

- libasound2-dev,
- timidity,
- pygame,
- pyqt5,
- music21,
- numpy,
- tensorflow.

The project is not finished yet. What we have already done is:

:heavy_check_mark: creating first neural network and training it,\
:heavy_check_mark: creating MIDI file generator based on the NN,\
:heavy_check_mark: creating GUI - main, generation, library and about windows,\
:heavy_check_mark: realising that the first NN wasn't that great,\
:heavy_check_mark: designing another (better) NN and training it.

What we still need to do:

:hammer: update MIDI file generator,\
:hammer: train some NNs, each fed data set of different genre,\
:hammer: build trained models into the program,\
:hammer: put it all together.

Hope you're here for the **grand opening** :closed_umbrella:
